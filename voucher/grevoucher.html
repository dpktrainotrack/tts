                                    The GRE General Test is essentially a top-rated global entry examination into graduate and business schools. It is managed by ETS, which is a standard-setting organization that measures your verbal reasoning, quantitative reasoning, critical thinking,
                                    and analytical writing abilities — all necessary skills for academic achievements in higher education.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The cost of a GRE is usually quite high, so the majority of students opt for a GRE voucher to book the exam at a discounted price without extra card fees or any other invisible charges. Consequently, the entire GRE exam registration becomes more convenient,
                                    affordable, and hassle-free for candidates spread all over India.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    Usually, the GRE results can be checked online within 10-15 days after the test. Once the scores are ready, an email notification with detailed instructions on how to access them is sent to candidates. By using this email, students can access their ETS
                                    account via the official GRE portal in order to see their results. Moreover, from the same account, scores can be forwarded directly to the graduate schools, universities, or fellowship programs that the candidate chooses.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The GRE is scored on different scales: 130–170 for Verbal Reasoning, 130–170 for Quantitative Reasoning, and 0–6 for Analytical Writing. Besides the raw scores, ETS gives a percentile ranking, which makes it easier for the test takers to know their position
                                    relative to the others who took the GRE globally. This is very helpful when deciding which university to send your application to, as it allows you to know your strong and weak sides.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    In order for it to be fair and trustworthy, ETS merges the score given by the AI system and the one given by a human expert. This system of double control ensures that the results are correct, authentic, and secure, and also that a mistake or a fraudulent
                                    activity does not happen.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    GRE test with the voucher is not only the most reasonable move but also the most affordable choice for the test-takers in India. Instead of paying the full exam fees, candidates can obtain GRE exam vouchers at a discounted rate from authorized resellers,
                                    which is both secure and user-friendly. Whether you are a student submitting applications for graduate schools, a working professional thrifty planning for higher studies abroad, or an independent learner, discounted
                                    vouchers provide you with the advantage of booking your GRE test date at a center near you without worrying about increasing expenses.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    In case of multiple attempts or group registrations, using bulk GRE vouchers would be more cost-effective, thus making them an excellent option for the coaching centers, training academies, and institutions located in Punjab, Haryana, Kerala, Gujarat,
                                    and other areas of India, where the GRE requirement has been continually increasing.
